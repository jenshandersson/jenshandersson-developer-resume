# Jens Andersson's Developer/Design Resume
I'm a fullstack tech genius with a love for mobile apps. I've published and helped publish several apps for both iOS and Android

I've been coding since I was 8, back then it was mostly VB Script and Basic today it's whatever is cool for the moment. I got into mobile apps early on and today I'm a massive fan of React Native, building native apps with JS. Working as CTO at ETV/The Yacht Week has massively improved my management skills, but I never would stop coding and building things.
